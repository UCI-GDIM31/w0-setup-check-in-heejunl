# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
I am heejun lee. Pronouns he/him. I born in korea but I lived in texas. My favorite game is EA SPORTS FC 24 and league of legends. As i play, i hope to get a little better with each game, and i hope that this class will help my favorite game develop further so that everyone can play it without difficulty and with ease every time they play.
2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class? I want to learn how to make games and how to improve existing games further.
4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class? I didn't learn about computer programming and I am not good at using computer. That makes me nervous.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

2. Game development (any engine)

3. Unity

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

2. Scope management

3. Iteration
